# Introduction

Apollo is a tool for collaborative, customizable, and scalable graphical genome
annotation.

<!-- These docs are aimed at those who are installing or managing a full
collaborative installation of Apollo. We need a separate section at some point
for user guides and information about Apollo on JBrowse Desktop. -->

## Try it out

several options, ranging from trying out our public demo to quickly installing
your own local version.

## Installation

Are you ready to deploy a multi-user Apollo installation? See our full
[installation instructions](installation/background).

## Guides

Once you have Apollo set up, see our guides to learn how to add your genomes and
annotations. You can also learn how to customize Apollo to better fit your
needs.
