# Try out Apollo

There are a few different ways you can try out Apollo, ranging from taking a
quick look to provisioning a full multi-user installation.

## Check out out quick-look demo

To quickly see what Apollo looks like and get a basic idea of its functionality,
visit this link:

[Try Apollo now!](https://demo.apollo.jbrowse.org/?session=share-oPRJK2yMUq&password=qMrK4)

Log in either as a guest or use a Google account.

The genome annotation database you see when you open this link represents a
small slice of a genome stored directly in your JBrowse session. This genome
database is not collaborative: anything you change is limited to your current
browsing session and is only visible to you. Anything you do on this genome
won't affect anyone else's experience, so feel free to experiment however you
like. If you want to start fresh again without any of your changes, you can open
the original link again.

## Try our full demo

If you want to explore some larger genome annotation databases that are
collaborative (meaning any changes you make will be visible to other users),
there are a few other genomes loaded on our demo server.

Click the link given in the quick-look demo above, go to the "Add" menu and
choose "Linear genome view," choose either "Schistosoma haematobium" or
"Schistosoma mansoni," and click "Open". To see the Apollo track, open the track
selector and choose the "Annotations" track.

## Run Apollo on your own computer

If you'd like to try setting up Apollo yourself, either with data we provide or
with your own data, this tutorial on our website walks you through setting up an
Apollo instance that runs on your own computer, with all the steps for
configuring the server and loading data. This is a great way to test Apollo out
before doing a full multi-user installation

## Deploy a multi-user Apollo instance to a server

Our deployment guide walks you through installing a fully-featured multi-user
Apollo instance on a server, allowing you to take advantage of Apollo's
collaborative features to annotate your own genomes.
